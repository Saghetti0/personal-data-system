# personal-data-system

Monorepo for my personal data system (name subject to change), a unified notebook, database, and organizer for my life.

## Backstory

Once upon a time (in early 2025), I had a dream for an app I wanted to build. It was a note-taking app based on a simple idea: write often, write quickly, tag now, organize whenever. A notebook would consist of tons of "micro-notes", each containing some content, metadata, and tags. To organize your notebook, you would create dynamic lists called "feeds" that filtered and ordered your notes. From these simple primitives, you could create just about any organization system you wanted. As far as I can tell, there are no apps that do this quite as cleanly and simply as I'd like, so I set out to build it myself.

I then spent the next year working on it, on and off. I redesigned it, overengineered it, worked with friends for some parts (and solo for others), and dreamed of publicly launching it and building a company around it. Today, all I have to show is a folder full of design docs, and a (very) unfinished codebase. 

And yet, I still want it. If nothing else, because I belive it could improve my life greatly. So I've decided to leave my perfectionism behind, and Just Build It. All that matters is that it works well enough for me to use regularly, and can be iterated upon and improved. This repo is my humble attempt to do just that.

## Repo Structure

- `api/` - The core of the system. Stores all the data, does all the logic.
- `android/` - Android app
- ... and more to come (when I build it!)

## AI Usage

AI tools (particularly Claude Code) have become an important part of my workflow. I find that they compliment my working style quite well, allowing me to focus more on building what I want rather than the intricacies of exactly how to describe it in code. My AI usage generally falls into these categories:

- Completing grindy tasks (refactoring code, adding logging, implementing interfaces, porting across languages)
- Getting started with unfamiliar environments and tools
- Finishing small one-off tasks, like scripts and helpers

For any code generated with AI, I make sure to review it thoroughly for understanding. Everything else, including this very README, has been created by a human. Hello!
